<h2>2025/26 - Winter semester - <a href="https://usosweb.uwr.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=24-FZ-AS-S1-E3-AM3">Analiza matematyczna 3</a></h2>
<p>Tutorial class for Professor Tomasz Trześniewski’s lecture. Conducted in Polish. The class takes place in room 282 on Tuesdays from 11:15 to 13:45.</p>
<p>The course is focused on the theory of differential equations, Fourier series and distributions. It aims at practical skills of solving a Cauchy problem in abstract and physical realisations.</p>
<p>Below you will find some additional problem sets, comments, and, when necessary, additional information about the course.</p>

<h2>2022/23 - <a href="https://usosweb.uwr.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=24-FZ-S1-Wgr">Wstęp do geometrii różniczkowej</a></h2>
<p>In the 2022/23 academic year, I attended Professor Andrzej Frydryszak’s lecture on differential geometry. His clear explanations and deep insight made the subject come alive for me. It was this lecture that introduced me to the world of geometry — a field I quickly grew to love, and whose applications still surprise and fascinate me.
</p><p>
While still a student, I decided to collect my notes from Professor Frydryszak’s lectures, add some short comments, pictures, and theorems from the exercises, and turn them into a set of lecture notes.
With the Professor’s permission, I’m sharing them here, available to other students. Please note that there may be some mistakes or typos — if you find any, I’d really appreciate it if you let me know so I can fix them.
I’d also like to expand these notes with more topics useful for students of theoretical (and especially mathematical) physics, so I’ll be updating and improving the text whenever I have time.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, because of the language of my undergraduate studies, the notes are (at least for now) only available in Polish.</p>
