<h2><a href="https://alienanietka.github.io/awojnar/">Professor Aneta Wojnar</a></h2>
<p>Professor Wojnar is an Assistant Professor at the University of Wrocław. She is a supervisor for my master's thesis. She works on gravity and thermodynamics of gravitational systems. She's involved in popularisation of science, which includes e.g. writing children's books about physics.</p>

  This photo of Aneta was taken by Paweł Piotrowski for the University of Wrocław when her COST ACTION project was first announced. The project, which she proposed and chairs, is <a href="https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA24101/">Testing Fundamental Physics with Seismology (FuSe)</a> – a multidisciplinary research network aimed at bringing physical considerations down to Earth, exploring possibilities and applications.

<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/KNFMigacz">Student Association "MIGACZ"</a></h2>
<p>During my master's and bachelor's studies, I had the remarkable pleasure of being a member of the Student Association "Migacz" at the University of Wrocław.
  Together with "Migacz", we have organized conferences such as <a href="https://indico.global/event/10053/">“Karpacz Winter Kindergarten of Theoretical Physics”</a>, as well as lectures and presentations for younger students. Our student association is actively involved in a wide range of events — academic, scientific, social, and more. It brings together students from various disciplines, including theoretical and experimental physics, astronomy, and related fields.
  <br>
I encourage you to check their social media.</p>
