<h2>2025 - Master thesis</h2>
<p>For the last year of my master's studies I've been working on my thesis under supervision of professor Aneta Wojnar. The topic of the thesis is "Concept of Mass in Extensions of General Relativity".
</p>
<p>
The idea of mass and matter can be understood on several levels. In thermodynamics mass is meant to measure amount of matter, meanwhile other classical theory – Newtonian mechanics – distinguish two types of mass: gravitational one, responsible for interactions and acting as a gravitational charge, and inertial one – measure of resistance against any force acting on a given body. Quantum Field Theory provides description of mass in terms of energy of interactions, both with Higgs field and strong interactions between quarks.
<br>
On the other hand, in General Relativity definition of mass/energy remains somewhat ambiguous, sometimes being property of matter, another time quantity related to spacetime itself. Hypotheses of extended GR, such as f(R) or scalar-tensor models, inevitably inherit this ambiguity and expand it, providing description of such objects as gravisphere. Moreover, additional fields (scalar, vector or tensor fields in scalar-tensor, vector-tensor and tensor-tensor models respectively) may be characterized by “mass” quantity, which can be effectively coupled to geometry, and therefore leads to spontaneous changes in geometry.

<h2>2023 - Bachelor thesis</h2>
<p>During last year of my bachelor studies I was working under supervision of professor Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman on the hypothesis called Doubly Special Relativity (or Deformed Special Relativity).
</p>
<p>
This proposition postulates introducing another observer-invariant scale (energy or length). Constructed in such way spacetime requires usage of noncommutative algebras with bracket action, which in limit should reduce to Poincare algebra. In my thesis "Uncertainty relations in Deformed Special Relativity" I investigated quantum limit of this hypothesis, in which brackets should reduce to commutators, and therefore provide nontrivial uncertainty relations. On a cosmic scale, where observations of high-energetic particles are possible, stochastic noise produced by these uncertainties appear to be negligible comparing to both” other aspects of the hypothesis and  real-world measurement possibilities.
